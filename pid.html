<h1 align = center> What is yoga ? </h1> <!-- can also align left, right and justify-->

<pre><b><i>Yoga is an ancient system of physical, mental, and spiritual practices originating in India.
The Sanskrit root word, Yuj, means "to join," "to unite," or "to yoke".
This reflects the ultimate aim of yoga: to create a harmonious union between the individual consciousness and the universal consciousness.

<h1><strong>Core concepts and definitions- </strong></h1>
Classical yoga texts offer several defining principles:

Yogaś citta-vritti-nirodhaḥ: This definition from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras describes yoga as the "cessation of the modifications of the mind". By stilling the restless mind, one can perceive their true nature, or "Self".
Samatvam Yoga Uchyate: The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as "equanimity" or a balanced state of mind in both success and failure.

Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam: Another definition from the Bhagavad Gita states that yoga is "skill in action". It is a way of acting efficiently without being overly attached to the results. </i> </b></pre>

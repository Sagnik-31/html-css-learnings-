I want you to stay 
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, alright
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me

Nothing left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more

It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya

You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, no
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I

Don't wanna say goodbye
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day I die)
But if it's forever, it's even better

I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised
